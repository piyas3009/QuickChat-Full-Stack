A full-stack real-time chat application built with React, Node.js, Socket.io, and MongoDB. It allows users to sign up, log in, chat in real time, and share messages with optional image uploads. The app supports live message delivery using WebSockets, unseen message tracking, and user authentication with JWT.
Designed to be responsive and fast, this project demonstrates how to build scalable and interactive chat features using modern web technologies.
